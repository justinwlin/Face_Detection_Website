# Face_Detection_Website

Worked to teach myself fullstack development by creating this website. 
Used Clarifai API in order to detect faces in an uploaded image URL. 

Used React, Node.js, and Postgresql in order to create the project and deployed online on Heroku. [Here] (https://smartbrainjwl.herokuapp.com/) (Server may currently be down due to lack of traffic and reducing the usage of bills).

## Things to Improve on:
- [ ] Allowing the website to detect multiple faces instead of just one
- [ ] Feedback / Error message if registering or signin fails. 
- [ ] Trimming for white spaces in username
- [ ] Adding ability to change a forgotten password
